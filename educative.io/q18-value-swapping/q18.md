18. Swap the values of two variables without a temporary variable

Implement swap() which swaps the value of two variables without using a third variable.
While this may be tricky in other languages, Go makes it easy.

Tip: We can simply include the statement b, a = a, b, what data the variable references without engaging with either value.
