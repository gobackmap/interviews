24. Merge Sort

Implement a concurrent Merge Sort solution using goroutines and channels.

You can use the sequential Merge Sort implementation as a starting point:

Tip on s24:
Firstly, in merge sort, we keep dividing our array recursively into the right side and the left side and call the MergeSort function on both sides from line 47 to line 55.

Now we have to make sure that Merge(left,right) is executed after we get return values from both the recursive calls, i.e. both the left and right must be updated before Merge(left,right) can be executable. Hence, we introduce a channel of type bool and send true on it as soon as left = ConcurrentMergeSort(data[:mid]) is executed.

The <-done operation blocks the code before the statement Merge(left,right) so that it does not proceed until our goroutine has finished. After the goroutine has finished and we receive true on the done channel, the code proceeds forward to Merge(left,right) statement.
