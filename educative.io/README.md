- This project was inspired by "Crack the top 50 Golang interview questions" article in
https://www.educative.io/blog/50-golang-interview-questions.

- You can run
```bash
    go run qXX-YYY/sXX.go
```    
 where XX is an existing question number and YYY is the title of the question.
 Feel free to check the Makefile.
