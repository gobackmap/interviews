25. Sum of Squares

Implement the SumOfSquares function which takes an integer, c and returns the sum of all squares between 1 and c. Youâ€™ll need to use select statements, goroutines, and channels.

For example, entering 5 would return 55 because 
    
    1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 55

You can use the following code as a starting point:
========================================================================================
package main

import "fmt"

func SumOfSquares(c, quit chan int) {

	// your code here

}

func main() {

	mychannel := make(chan int)

	quitchannel := make(chan int)

	sum := 0

	go func() {
		for i := 0; i < 6; i++ {
			sum += <-mychannel
		}
		fmt.Println(sum)
	}()
	SumOfSquares(mychannel, quitchannel)
}
